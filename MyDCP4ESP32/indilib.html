<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Before starting the driver, make sure all temperature probes are connected and then power on the controller. All temperature values reported in the driver interface are in degrees celsius.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When running the driver for the first time, go to the <b>Connection</b> tab and select Network and the port to connect to. After making changes in the Connection tab, go to <strong>Options</strong> tab and save the settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><i class="fa fa-gears"></i> Operation</h2>
<h3>Connection Tab</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Connection support is based on the configuration of the firmware when built and installed on the controller. TCP/IP network connections are recommended but serial connections via USB is also supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul  style="padding-left: 50px;">
<li><strong>Network</strong>: WiFi connectivity in either Access Point Mode or Station Mode. Use TCP with the default port number of 3131. mDNS support is available with a default name of mydcp4esp32.local otherwise and IP address will need to be used.

<li><strong>Serial</strong>: Serial connectivity via USB is supported with a default speed of 57,600 baud.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Main Control Tab</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The main control tab is where the tracking mode used for setting the outputs of the dew
    controller is set and the primary information used by the controller is reported.</p>

            <h4>Determining how much power to apply to the Dew Straps</h4>
            <p>There needs to be a way to calculate how much power to apply to the dew straps based
                on some value (<mark>tracking mode</mark>) as well as a range of temperature bands
                (<mark>range</mark>) over which the dew strap power is altered.</p>
            <p>In general, most dew controllers operate relative to the dew point temperature, and
                try to maintain the telescope optics temperature at some delta point above the dew
                point. The myDCP4ESP32 controller has three different methods of maintaining optics
                temperature which are</p>
            <ul  style="padding-left: 50px;">
                <li>Ambient</li>
                <li>Dew point</li>
                <li>Midpoint</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users are advised to spend an evening session monitoring the values, trying various
                tracking modes and offset values to determine what they feel is best for their
                equipment setup. Having the flexibility of adjustment provided by the myDCP4ESP32
                unit should meet even the most demanding of situations.</p>
            <h4>Temperature Tracking Algorithms</h4>
            <p>Power output to a dew controller channel is determined by the tracking mode and the
                adjusted temperature of channels temperature probe. The output is determined as
                indicated in the following table.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/devices/MyDCP4ESP32/tracking_algorithms.jpg"
                    alt="Tracking Algorithms"
                    style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
            <h4>Tracking Examples</h4>
            <p><strong>Ambient</strong></p>
            <p>Power output for a channel is determined by the number of degrees celsius the probe
                temperature is below ambient temperature.
                If the probe temperature is 5 degrees below ambient then the power output is set to
                50% for the dew strap port.</p>
            <p><strong>Dew point</strong></p>
            <p>Power output for a channel is determined by the number of degrees celsius the probe
                temperature is away from the calculated
                dew point temperature. As the probe temperature drops towards the dew point power to
                the dew strap port is increased until
                it reaches 100% at 1 degree above the dew point.</p>
            <p><strong>Midpoint</strong></p>
            <p>Power output for a channel is determined by the number of degrees celsius the probe
                temperature is relative to the midpoint
                between the ambient temperature and the dew point. If the ambient temperature is
                20&#8451; and the dew point is 2&#8451;
                then the midpoint is 11&#8451;, <var style="white-space: nowrap;">(AT-DP)/2</var>.
                If the probe temperature is at or above 20&#8451; then output is 0%
                but as the probe temperature drops below 17&#8451;, <var
                    style="white-space: nowrap;">AT&lt;3</var>, power is set to 10%. When the probe
                temperature drops
                to the midpoint, 11&#8451;, then power is set to 20% until probe temperature drops
                to 9&#8451;, <var style="white-space: nowrap;">AT-(((AT-DP)/2)+2)</var>
                where power is set to 50%. At the dew point, 2&#8451;, and below power is 100%.</p>
            <p><strong>Tracking Offset</strong></p>
            <p>Tracking offset is set in the <strong>Options</strong> tab and affects the algorithms
                by adjusting them by the offset. For example with Ambient tracking a tracking offset
                of 3 would adjust the ambient algorithm up 3&#8451;. This would cause output to be
                10% at 2&#8451; above ambient temperature instead of 1&#8451; below ambient
                temperature.</p>
