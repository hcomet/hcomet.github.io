            <span class="fs-4 fw-normal">
                <p>The ease of building the CheapoDC is dependent on the number of controller outputs. Each
                    output requires a MOSFET module and each module requires six connections. Two connections for 12
                    volt power input, two for the controlled power output and then two connections to the ESP32-C3 to
                    trigger the MOSFETs. This means that a minimal two output controller requires a dozen connections
                    and wires for the outputs. Fairly easy and manageable. A controller with the maximum six outputs
                    requires three dozen connections and wires for the outputs. Not particularly complex, but fitting all those
                    wires in a small case can be a lot less easy and manageable.</p>
                <p>I use devices with two RCA outputs since I only have need to control two dew straps on my rigs.
                    The basics of the original CheapoDC 2-Output build is shown on the main <a

                        target="_blank">CheapoDC repository page</a>. However, many astrophotographers require more
                    than two dew controller outputs and would also like the option to control other accessories.
                </p>
                <p>This document provides details, including parts list, assembly steps and 3D case, for building a
                    3&#8209;Output CheapoDC and a 6&#8209;Output CheapoDC. Control of three outputs should cover
                    almost all situations where dew heater straps are required while continuing to be very easy to
                    build. Six outputs provides the flexibility to control several dew heater straps as well as some
                    12V accessories such as a camera cooler.

                    hold a front and back panel. The bottom pieces are designed to hold the modules used in each
                    build and allow them to be screwed down. The panels are designed to hold the jacks, switches and
                    LEDs. The front panel is referred to as the <span class="fst-italic">switch-panel</span> and the
                    back panel as the <span class="fst-italic">output-panel</span> in the build description. The top

                    </li>
                    <li>The LEDs that are mounted in the panels are held in place by a 3D printable holder with a press
                        fit backing piece. There's also a printable tool to drive the backing piece onto the LED holder.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are two sets of panels for the 6-Outlet case. One set with LED holes for each output and
                        one set without LED holes.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are two versions of the 6-Output case bottom. One which provides a mounting spot for the
                        protoboard based ESP32-C3-board and one which provides an alternate mounting for the ESP32-C3
                        SuperMini Expansion board.
                    </li>
                    <li>The protoboard based Power-board requires a mounting ring to hold it to the case bottom. It
                        is also 3D printable.

                <p>The 3&#8209;Output CheapoDC is significantly simpler to build than the 6&#8209;Output version due
                    to the reduced number of outputs that need to be connected. This build has all three outputs set
                    up for dew straps with RCA jacks. The third output could be changed over to a switched 12 volt
                    barrel jack or left out completely if needed.
                </p>
                <p>Wiring requires a combination of 10cm female to female Dupont jumpers and 18 gauge silicone wire.
                    If you plan to use the CheapoDC for more than a total of 72 Watts or 6 amps at 12 volts then you
                    may want to use 16 gauge wire for the power harnesses. You may also want to use a PPTC
                    resettable fuse with a higher rating or one per output.

                            potentiometer on the buck converter until the meter reads 5 volts. Since the wiring for power
                            was completed in the previous step you should be able to plug in a 12 volt supply to the barrel
                            jack and switch on the buck converter. With a small screw driver adjust the potentiometer on the
                            buck converter by turning the small screw until your voltmeter reads 5 volts. Assuming you have
                            not previously adjusted the buck converter, it should be set to maximum and show about 12 volts.
                            Turning the screw counter clockwise will reduce the output voltage. It may take quite a few
                            turns before you see any change in the output and then it will change quickly.

                                before they are mounted in the case output-panel. Cut six pieces of wire long enough to reach from the

                                so that they will reach the appropriate
                                <span class="fw-medium">VIN+</span> connection on each module. Strip the ends, insert

                            <p> Use two Dupont jumpers to daisy chain the ground pin connections between the MOSFET modules. These will be routed
                                under the RCA jacks on the output-panel.

                                <span class="fw-medium">OUT-</span> connections on each module. Strip the ends, insert the ends into the terminals
                                and tighten the screws.
                            </p>
                            <p>Connect the ESP32-C3 to the MOSFET modules. Use one Dupont jumper to connect the ground pin on the left-most MOSFET
                                module to any of the ground pins on the ESP32-C3 expansion board (black pins). Use two more Dupont jumpers to
                                connect the trigger pins on the left-most MOSFET module and center MOSFET MODULE to GPIO pins 0 and 1 on the
                                ESP32-C3 expansion board (yellow pins). If using 10cm long Dupont jumpers then you will need to cut the ends off two
                                of them and splice them together to make a longer wire. This will then be used to connect the trigger pin on the
                                right-most MOSFET module to GPIO pin 3 on the ESP32-C3 expansion board (yellow pin).

            <span class="fw-normal fs-4">
                <p>This 6 output device was built for firmware testing and demonstration purposes, not to be used on an
                    actual astrophotography rig and as such this affected some aspects of the design. If you are building
                    a 6-Output CheapoDC for personal use on your astrophotography rig, consider the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>There is an external LED for each output to help with testing. In general,
                        having a lot of flashing red LEDs on an astrophotography rig is not a good idea. Only the status
                        LED should be needed on a 'production' CheapoDC.
                    </li>
                
                    <li>The CheapoDC firmware will support from one to 6&#8209;Outputs. The first two are assumed to be dew controller
                        outputs but the additional four may be configured as dew controller, PWM or boolean (on/off) outputs. This design
                        supports the maximum 6&#8209;Outputs supported by CheapoDC firmware. Four outputs have RCA jacks, commonly used for
                        dew straps, and two outputs have 5.5mm X 2.1mm barrel jacks. The number of outputs and balance of RCA versus barrel
                        jacks can be configured based on personal need.</li>
                    <li>I used crimp connectors for connections between the modules to allow for more flexible testing. Crimping Molex or 
                        Dupont jumpers is not hard but it requires patience and a crimping tool. If you don't wish to invest in a crimping 
                        tool and connectors, soldering the wires is an alternative. The <a href="#3-output-build"

                    Building the ESP32-C3-board and the Power-board should be completed before assembling your

                <span class="fw-normal fs-4">
                    <p>The ESP32-C3-board provides a socket for the ESP32-C3 SuperMini as well as pin headers for power and GPIOs. An image
                        of the board is shown to the right. The schematic below the image shows the connections between the female headers
                        for the ESP32-C3 SuperMini and the male headers for power and GPIO pins. Theres also a row of ground pins on either
                        side.
                    </p>
                    <p>The board is made by cutting down some protoboard to fit the 30mmx25mm mounting area in the case bottom. The piece
                        should come from the edge of the protoboard where there is a 3mm edging as shown at the top of the image. The
                        orientation of the board is important so that it lines up properly with the screw holes in the base. The board
                        should be 11 holes wide by 8 deep. You'll need to use a small drill bit (3mm) to drill out the mounting holes as
                        shown in the image. Drill the holes before soldering the pin headers. The board image and schematic are both
                        oriented with the ESP32-C3 SuperMini USB socket at the bottom.
                    </p>
                    <p>The board pin to pin connections are all soldered on the underside of the board. When connecting the two rows of
                        ground pins together the connecting wire needs to cross through the middle of the bottom of the board or across the
                        top otherwise the board will not mount properly into the case bottom.
                    </p>
                    <p>Soldering all the pins together on the bottom of the board can take a lot of patience and you must be careful not to
                        short pins together that should not be connected. Once done its good to test all the pins with a multimeter to make
                        sure that they are all connected properly. If you don't want to spend the time putting this board together then an
                        alternative is to use an <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-trigger="focus hover"

                        both a completed Power-board as well as the schematic. The screw terminal blocks, J1 and J2, have 5.08mm spaced
                        pins. J3 is a 2 pin male 2.54mm header while J4 is a 2 pin Molex KK-254 male jack. The terminal blocks could be
                        replaced with direct soldering to the Power-board. Male 2.54mm pin headers could be used for both J3 and J4 instead
                        of using a Molex KK-254 jack.
                    </p>
                    <p> This piece of protoboard is 27 mm wide by 32 mm deep. The size is important for it to fit in the spot reserved for
                        it in the case bottom. Unlike the ESP32-C3-board, the Power-board is held down to the case bottom using a screwed in
                        3D-printed hold down ring. Similar to the ESP32-C3-board, solder the connections on the underside of the board.

                            <p>There are three power harnesses, one 12V harness for each of the two sets of MOSFET modules and
                                one ground harness. Use the populated case bottom to measure the lengths of wire needed for the
                                harnesses using the routing indicated in the image. Red lines are 12V and dark grey lines are
                                ground. The 12V harnesses use 18 gauge wire while the ground harness uses a combination of 16
                                and 18 gauge wire.
                            </p>
                            <p>The 12V harnesses are each connected to one of the 12V output terminals on the Power-board. Using
                                the image cut a single wire for each long enough to reach from the 12V output terminal to the
                                farthest MOSFET module on the route plus at least 5cm. Then splice in two shorter pieces of wire
                                for the first two MOSFET modules on each harness. Keep the wires long, we'll cut them down
                                later. Cover the splices with tape or heat shrink tubing.

                            <p>Make the ground harness in a similar manner except that it routes from the negative terminal of
                                the Power-board. There is a shorter piece of 16 gauge wire that goes from the Power-board ground
                                terminal to the first splice that splits the ground into two 18 gauge wires running to three
                                MOSFET modules each.

                            <p>The output-panel has the four additional outputs supported by CheapoDC firmware, which may be configured to be either
                                dew controller, independent PWM or Boolean (On/Off) outputs via the Web UI. Two of the outputs have the RCA jacks
                                commonly used by dew straps while two have 5.5mmx2.1mm 12v barrel jacks. The RCA jacks go in the larger holes with
                                LEDs holders in the holes above them. The other four holes are for the barrel jacks and their LEDs. LED holders are
                                stacked to the outside (left) of the panel while the barrel jacks go in the two holes stacked to the inside (right).
                                Picking the right holes is important because they are placed to allow the jacks to fit with the MOSFETs and tight
                                space in the case.
                            </p>

                                If using output LEDs then all four should be mounted in the case first using the 3D
                                printed LED mounts.
                                The jacks will also need to be inserted in the panel holes before soldering. The
                                soldering instructions for the RCA jacks are the same as in the switch-panel build step.
                            </p>
                            <p>The barrel jack soldering is very similar to the steps for the RCA jacks. The only difference is that the wires for
                                the bottom barrel jack must be long enough to reach diagonally across the case to the furthest MOSFET module.
                            </p>
                            <p>Note that polarity doesn't usually matter for Dew Straps since they are simple resistive loads. But, keeping the
                                polarity correct for the RCA jack outputs as well as the barrel jack outputs is good practice. In particular, any
                                output that may be used for a purpose other than dew straps should definitely keep the polarity correct.

                            <p>This is where the build becomes significantly less easy. Installing the output-panel requires that the wire leads for
                                the jacks in the output-panel be trimmed to length, the ends stripped and then inserted into the appropriate MOSFET
                                module terminals. There is very little room and inserting the tips of the stripped wires into the terminal blocks
                                can be very frustrating.

                                the MOSFET module terminal block is very tight. You may need to disconnect the J1 Power-board connections before
                                doing the MOSFET module connections. Then reconnect the Power-board connections.

                helps with visual verification of the output of the MOSFET modules but you will still need to check
                each output jack to confirm the connections to the jacks. There are a couple of ways to verify the

                        12V barrel jacks which will require a matching barrel plug with test leads.

                        <p>If the status LED does not blink at all then there may be a connection issue:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm that the ESP32-C3 is getting power. The red power LED on the ESP32-C3 SuperMini should
                                be on when power is on. There is also an LED on the buck converter that should be On. If either
                                of these LEDs are not lit then there is a power connection issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>If using an ESP32-C3 SuperMini expansion board, the board also has a green LED that flashes when
                                the board is powered. If it is not flashing then the expansion board is not getting power. Check
                                the 5V and ground connections.
                            </li>
                            <li>The ESP32-C3 SuperMini has a blue LED connected to GPIO8. If it does not blink and
                                then remain on then there may be an issue with the ESP32-C3 SuperMini. Pull the ESP32-C3
                                SuperMini from the expansion board. Then power it from a USB connection on its own. If
                                the power LED is on but the blue light remains off try uploading the firmware again

                        <h4>Trouble shooting:</h4>
                        <p>Note that a MOSFET module's LEDs will light up when there is voltage applied to the ground and trigger inputs.</p>
                        <p>If a MOSFET module LED does not light up then then there is likely an issue with the GPIO
                            connection. This could be:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A bad jumper wire. Try an alternate.
                            </li>
                            <li>Reversed jumper connection. Make sure the ground and GPIO pin are connected correctly to
                                the ground and trigger input on the MOSFET module.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bad solder joint for the trigger connection. Try re-soldering.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>If all output LEDs do not light up but the MOSFET LEDs do, then there is likely an issue with
                            your Power-board or power harnesses. You'll need to check all the 12V and ground screw terminals
                            with a voltmeter to find where the issue is.
                        </p>
                        <p>If an individual output LED is not lighting up but the MOSFET LED is then:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Verify that power is getting to the MOSFET module by using a voltmeter with probes on the VIN+
                                and VIN- terminal screw heads. If it is not reading 12 volts then there is either an issue with
                                the terminal connection to the power harness or the harness itself. Use the voltmeter to check
                                the harness. You may need to check back to the Power-board.
                            </li>
                            <li>With Output set to 100% for the MOSFET module (MOSFET module LED should be on), check the VOUT+
                                and VOUT- screw heads with a voltmeter. If it shows 12V then the output jack connections need to
                                be checked. If it doesn't then there may be an issue with the MOSFET module and you'll need to
                                replace it.
                            </li>
